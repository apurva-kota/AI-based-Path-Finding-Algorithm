# AI based Path Finding Algorithm
**AI-Based Path Finding Algorithm** is a visualization project that demonstrates how different algorithms traverse from a source node to a destination node in a graph-like environment. The project highlights the behavior of various pathfinding algorithms, showcasing how they navigate through nodes while encountering potential obstacles or challenges.

Key features of the project include:
- **Algorithm Visualization**: The project visualizes different algorithms, such as A* (A-star), BFS and DFS, as they traverse from the starting point to the destination, dynamically showing their decision-making process.
- **Obstacle Handling**: If obstacles (like walls) appear during traversal, the algorithm recalculates and alters its path to find an optimal route around these obstacles.
- **Random Maze Generation**: The project includes the creation of random mazes, adding complexity and unpredictability to the environment, which further tests the algorithms' efficiency and adaptability in real-time.

This project provides an interactive and educational tool for understanding how pathfinding algorithms operate in varying conditions.
